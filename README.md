# Collective Palates, or Taste Dialects, across the United States

This repository is very preliminary currently. We have a few scripts for extracting mentions of authenticity, as well as adjectives, from Yelp's Open Dataset, and a few plots in a Jupyter Notebook demonstrating the potential of this study. 

Packages needed: 
- fastparquet and python-snappy
- pandas
- json
- seaborn
- tqdm
